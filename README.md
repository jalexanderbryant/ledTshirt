Welcome to the software guide for the Marquee Tee! This will also serve as a repositiory for all code needed to get up and running.

First, you'll need to collect a Raspberry Pi with built-in Wifi capabilities (or an older version and a Wifi dongle). Next, load a fresh version of Raspbian onto a micro SD card with at least 8GB of storage. The official guide for doing that is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)

Once you install your operating system and plug the SD card into the Pi, go ahead and connect a keyboard, an HDMI monitor, and power it on through the micro usb jack. When your Pi boots and you get a command line prompt, type the following commands in, hitting enter after every line and waiting to enter the next until you're given another command prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/sphawes/ledTshirt.git
cd ledTshirt
```
