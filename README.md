# Marquee Tee
## Tom's Hardware <> Stephen Hawes

Welcome to the software guide for the Marquee Tee! This will also serve as a repositiory for all code needed to get up and running.
First, you'll need to collect a Raspberry Pi with built-in Wifi capabilities (or an older version and a Wifi dongle). Next, load a fresh version of Raspbian onto a micro SD card with at least 8GB of storage. The official guide for doing that is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
